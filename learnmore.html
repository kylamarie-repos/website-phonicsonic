            <h1>Learn more:</h1>
            <p>There are essentially two stages to literacy learning:
                <ul>
                    <li>Phonics - giving the basic ability to read and write</li>
                    <li>Grammar - giving the broader skills to be able to communicate well</li>
                </ul>
                PhonicSonic is dedicated to making the early stages of childhood education an engaging and enjoyable journey through the world of Phonics. Our approach to Phonics education is designed to captivate young minds through a dynamic and multisensory teaching method. By immersing children in the exciting world of letter sounds, we empower them to unlock the magic of reading and writing words. Our mission is to foster a love for language and literacy that will lay a strong foundation for a lifetime of learning and communication.
                <br/><br/>
                Within our comprehensive phonics program, we delve into the intricacies of English language sounds, encompassing not just the basic alphabet but a total of 42 essential sounds. Some of these sounds are represented by pairs of letters, known as digraphs, such as <i>ee</i> and <i>or</i>. The rich tapestry of English phonetics reveals intriguing nuances: both <i>oo</i> and <i>th</i> can manifest in dual sounds, exemplified by words like <i>book</i> and <i>moon</i>, <i>that</i> and <i>three</i>.
                <br/><br/>
                In our pedagogical approach, we emphasize that children should acquaint themselves with each letter through its phonetic sound rather than its conventional name. For instance, the letter <i>a</i> should be recognized as <i>a</i> (as heard in "ant") rather than <i>ai</i> (as in <i>ai</i>m). Similarly, the letter <i>n</i> should be associated with <i>n</i> (as in <i>n</i>et), not <i>en</i>. This fundamental distinction greatly aids in the process of blending sounds to form words. The formal letter names will be introduced at a later stage of learning.
                <br/><br/>
                To ensure a logical progression, we introduce the letters in a deliberate sequence, deviating from the standard alphabetical order. The initial set of letters (<i>s, a, t, i, p, n</i>) has been chosen strategically because they facilitate the creation of a greater number of simple three-letter words compared to any other set of six letters. Letters such as <i>b, d, q,</i> and <i>p</i> are introduced in separate groups to prevent potential confusion and facilitate a smoother learning experience.
